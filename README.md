# Eat-Da-Burger
*Create and devour burgers cybernetically! A second on the fingertips, never on the hips*

This web application allows people to enter a burger they would like to eat, have it appear in a list on the left of the page, devour the burger by clicking on the mouth, and have it appear beside an empty plate on the right of the page. The burgers are stored in a database rather than locally. The user input is checked on the front-end to ensure it will be accepted by the database, and the user alerted if that is not the case. The server also validates the input.

The program uses an MVC architecture (model, view, controller), and utilises jQuery, Bootstrap, Handlebars, Express,and MySQL. 

USER STORY:<br>
